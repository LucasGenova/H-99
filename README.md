# H99
My attempt at the 99 Haskell problems

I'm learning Haskell by following the [Haskell Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell) and solving the [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems). This repository is the collection of my solutions for the problems.
